## NOTES FOR BETWEEN-SESSION EXECUTION

This playbook is designed for **hands-off execution** between AI sessions. You should be able to execute this independently with minimal technical knowledge.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Automate what you can:** Stripe handles payments, email handles notifications
2. **Track everything:** Use Stripe dashboard and Google Analytics
3. **Focus on marketing:** Your main job is getting users, not building features
4. **Respond quickly:** Support emails and social media comments need 24-hour response
5. **Measure and adjust:** Weekly reviews help you focus on what's working

**Time Commitment:**
- Daily: 10-15 minutes
- Weekly: 1-1.5 hours
- Monthly: 2-3 hours
- **Total: ~2-3 hours per week**

This is achievable alongside your other commitments and leaves room for unexpected issues.
